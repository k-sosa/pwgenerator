# pwgenerator

Description//
This is a random password generator. When the 'generate password' button is clicked it will deliver a series of alert boxes. The first is one with a prompt of how long the user wants the pass word to be, followed by confirm statements about what type of characters the user wants in their passsword. After the user is done making their selections, a random password according to their specifications will appear in the textbox.

Code//
To generate each character I used fromCharCode method, it seemed to be the easiest way and cleanest. My tutor helped me put the users input into a function that stored the values and generated their password with an if else statement inside the function.

Style//
I styled my generator with the help of a youtube video from @WebDevSimplified. I did not use bootstrap, it is all CSS.

Learning//
This assignment helped me understand global and local scope. As well and gave me a better understanding of loops.
